# Avoid These Sources

❌ Random coupon aggregator sites with suspicious domains
❌ Social media "influencer" codes (unverified)
❌ Sites requiring payment for codes
❌ Pop-up coupon sites
❌ Any site not listed above
❌ Grey-market or unauthorized resellers

# Marketplace Seller Red Flags

⚠️ **Warning signs for third-party sellers:**
- Price significantly below all major retailers (50%+ off)
- Seller name you don't recognize
- Limited seller reviews or new seller
- Ships from overseas
- "Fulfilled by Amazon" but sold by unknown party
- No return policy or restocking fees

**Always prefer "Sold and shipped by [Major Retailer]" over marketplace sellers.**
