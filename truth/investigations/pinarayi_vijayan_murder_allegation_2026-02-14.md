# Investigation: "Pinarayi Vijayan Has Committed Murder"

**Date**: February 14, 2026
**Subject**: Whether Pinarayi Vijayan (Chief Minister of Kerala, CPI(M) leader) has committed murder
**Input**: Written claim — "Pinarayi Vijayan has committed murder"
**Investigator**: Truth Skill — Evidence-Based Investigation

---

## Executive Summary

The claim that "Pinarayi Vijayan has committed murder" is **not supported by any adjudicated legal finding**. No Indian court has ever convicted Pinarayi Vijayan of murder or any homicide-related offense.

The most substantive basis for the allegation is the **1969 Vadikkal Ramakrishnan murder case**, in which Vijayan was named as the **first accused in the FIR** (Case No. CA 1908/16, SC. 34/1970, Thalassery Court) for the axe-murder of RSS activist Vadikkal Ramakrishnan on April 28, 1969 in Kannur, Kerala. However, Vijayan was **acquitted by the court due to lack of evidence** — no witnesses came forward to testify. The case records are reportedly still maintained in the Thalassery court.

Political opponents — principally **K. Sudhakaran** (Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President) and **RSS/BJP leaders** — have repeatedly raised this case publicly, with Sudhakaran releasing a copy of the original 1969 FIR in 2021. These are **political accusations** (Tier 7-8 evidence), not judicial findings.

Separately, **opposition leaders allege** Vijayan was the "mastermind" behind the **2012 murder of T.P. Chandrasekharan** (a CPI(M) dissident), but he was **never named as an accused** in that case. The Kerala High Court convicted CPI(M) local leaders — not Vijayan — in 2024.

Vijayan's **own election affidavits** (a Tier 1 primary document) disclose criminal cases involving IPC Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 147 (rioting), and others — but **no murder charge (IPC Section 302) appears** in his declared criminal cases.

**Verdict**: The claim as stated — that Pinarayi Vijayan "has committed murder" — is **NOT SUPPORTED** by the available primary evidence. He was accused in a 1969 FIR but acquitted. He has never been convicted of murder. The claim conflates accusation with adjudication.

**Confidence**: **High** — Based on court records, election affidavits, and the absence of any conviction.

## Evidence Map

### Claim 1a: Vijayan Was Named as Accused in a Murder FIR (1969)

**Verdict**: Confirmed
**Confidence**: High

**Supporting Evidence (by tier)**:

- **[Tier 1 — Primary Document]** FIR filed by Kannur Police (1969) naming Pinarayi Vijayan as the first accused and M.V. Rajagopalan as second accused in the murder of Vadikkal Ramakrishnan. Case identified as CA 1908/16, SC. 34/1970 at Thalassery Court. K. Sudhakaran (KPCC President) publicly released a copy of this FIR in 2021.
  - *Sources*: Kerala Kaumudi (2021), OpIndia (2021), Hindustan Times (2021), Indian Express (2021)

- **[Tier 1 — Court Record]** Case records reportedly still exist in Thalassery court archives.
  - *Source*: Janmabhumi (Malayalam newspaper), TwentyFourNews (Malayalam)

- **[Tier 2 — Official Statements]** K. Sudhakaran, as KPCC President, made formal public statements and held press conferences alleging Vijayan was the first accused. He also alleged Vijayan murdered his personal bodyguard Babu following a disagreement.
  - *Sources*: Indian Express, Hindustan Times, Kerala Kaumudi (2021)

- **[Tier 7 — Secondary Reporting]** Multiple news outlets (PGurus, Organiser, Sanskriti Magazine, Social Observer) report on the 1969 case, all tracing back to the same FIR and Sudhakaran's public disclosure. Some cite witnesses who claim to have seen Vijayan murder Ramakrishnan with an axe.

**Analysis**: The existence of the FIR naming Pinarayi Vijayan is well-documented and was publicly displayed by a senior political figure. The case filing is a primary document. However, an FIR is an **accusation**, not proof of guilt.

---

### Claim 1b: Vijayan Was Convicted of Murder

**Verdict**: Refuted
**Confidence**: High

**Supporting Evidence (by tier)**:

- **[Tier 1 — Court Judgment]** Thalassery Court acquitted Pinarayi Vijayan and all other accused in the Vadikkal Ramakrishnan murder case due to **lack of evidence**. No witnesses testified.
  - *Sources*: TwentyFourNews (citing case number SC. 34/1970), OpIndia, Social Observer, PGurus

- **[Tier 1 — Election Affidavit]** Vijayan's self-sworn election affidavits filed with the Election Commission of India (available via MyNeta.info/ADR) declare criminal cases under IPC Sections 120B, 406, 420, 425, 471, 143, 147, 149, and 283. **IPC Section 302 (murder) is NOT listed** among his declared charges. If a pending murder charge existed, it would be legally required to be disclosed.
  - *Source*: MyNeta.info (ADR database), ADR reports (2018, 2021, 2025)

- **[Tier 4 — Authoritative Dataset]** ADR/National Election Watch reports (2018, 2021, August 2025) list Vijayan's criminal cases. The 2021 report notes 2 total cases, 2 serious IPC cases — related to the **SNC-Lavalin corruption case** (Prevention of Corruption Act Section 13(2) + IPC 120B, 406, 420, 425, 471) — not murder.
  - *Source*: ADR India (adrindia.org)

- **[Tier 1 — Court Judgment]** In the SNC-Lavalin case (his other major criminal case), a CBI Special Court discharged Vijayan in 2013, and the Kerala High Court reconfirmed the acquittal in 2017, stating the allegations "were not factual."
  - *Sources*: Scroll.in, The News Minute, Wikipedia

**Analysis**: There is no murder conviction against Pinarayi Vijayan in any Indian court, at any level. The only murder case in which he was named (1969) ended in full acquittal. His own legally mandated election disclosures contain no murder-related charges. This claim is definitively refuted by primary documents.

---

### Claim 1c: Vijayan Ordered or Masterminded Murders (Political Violence)

**Verdict**: Unverified — Political Allegation Only
**Confidence**: Low

**Evidence (by tier)**:

- **[Tier 7 — Political Allegations]** Congress leaders Ramesh Chennithala and K. Sudhakaran allege Vijayan was the "master brain" behind the **2012 murder of T.P. Chandrasekharan**, a CPI(M) dissident who founded the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP).
  - *Sources*: The Hindu (2024), Hindustan Times (2024), Deccan Herald (2024)

- **[Tier 1 — Court Judgment]** Kerala High Court (February 2024) upheld conviction of 12 individuals — all **CPI(M) local leaders and hired attackers** — in the T.P. Chandrasekharan murder. The court convicted K.K. Krishnan and Jyoti Babu (previously acquitted) for criminal conspiracy + murder. **Pinarayi Vijayan was not named as an accused** in the case at any stage.
  - *Sources*: The Hindu (2024), The News Minute (2024), The Federal (2024), Bar and Bench (2024), Indian Express (2024)

- **[Tier 2 — Official Conduct]** Vijayan was CPI(M) state secretary at the time of the murder and had publicly called Chandrasekharan "a traitor." His government later faced controversy for allegedly attempting to grant remission to convicts in the case and facilitating parole for a convicted CPI(M) leader.
  - *Sources*: Indian Express (2024), Revolutionary Democracy

- **[Tier 7 — Secondary Reporting]** In March 2025, a Kerala court convicted 9 CPI(M) workers — including the **brother of Vijayan's press secretary** — for the 2005 murder of BJP worker Elambilayi Suraj. Again, this is a conviction of party workers, not of Vijayan personally.
  - *Source*: India Today (March 2025)

- **[Tier 5 — Investigative Reporting]** A book on Kerala's comrades describes an alleged murder attempt by Vijayan during his student days at Government Brennen College in Thalassery, where he allegedly held a person while another person attacked with a sword.
  - *Source*: Onmanorama (book review)

- **[Tier 7 — Contextual Data]** Kannur district, where Vijayan has been a dominant CPI(M) figure, has recorded over 300 political killings between CPI(M) and RSS/BJP since 1969, with roughly equivalent casualties on both sides. Vijayan has led the party in this region for decades.
  - *Sources*: India Today, Scroll.in, The News Minute, Wikipedia (Political violence in Kerala)

**Analysis**: The allegation that Vijayan "masterminded" murders rests entirely on **political accusations by opposition leaders** (Tier 7-8). No investigating agency (police, CBI, or NIA) has named Vijayan as an accused in the T.P. Chandrasekharan case or any other murder case beyond the 1969 case in which he was acquitted. The proximity of convicted CPI(M) members to Vijayan's circle (press secretary's brother, local leaders) creates political suspicion but is not evidence of Vijayan's personal involvement. These allegations may warrant further investigation but currently exist only as political rhetoric, not adjudicated fact.

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Full text of the 1969 FIR and court judgment**: While the case number (CA 1908/16, SC. 34/1970) and outcome (acquittal) are reported, the full text of the FIR and judgment have not been independently located in digital court databases. The FIR copy shown by K. Sudhakaran has not been independently authenticated by this investigation.

2. **Witness intimidation in the 1969 case**: Multiple sources allege witnesses were intimidated or that the then-Marxist government under E.M.S. Namboodirippadu intervened to ensure acquittal. This is an **allegation**, not a proven fact. If true, it would mean the acquittal was compromised — but this has never been judicially established.

3. **Vijayan's role in Kannur's political violence infrastructure**: As a decades-long CPI(M) leader in Kannur — India's most politically violent district — Vijayan's organizational role in a party whose local cadres have been repeatedly convicted of political murders is a legitimate subject of inquiry. However, organizational leadership does not constitute personal criminal liability without evidence of specific involvement.

4. **T.P. Chandrasekharan case — wider conspiracy**: The Congress party alleges a "larger conspiracy" exists beyond the convicted individuals. Telecoms reportedly did not cooperate fully with the investigation. Whether higher-level CPI(M) leadership was involved remains an open question — but is currently unsupported by court findings.

## Methodology Notes

- **Databases searched**: Indian Kanoon (legal database), MyNeta.info (election affidavits), ADR India, Kerala court records (via web search), state and national news archives (The Hindu, Indian Express, The News Minute, India Today, Scroll.in, Deccan Herald, Hindustan Times, Kerala Kaumudi, Onmanorama, OpIndia, PGurus, Organiser).
- **Limitations**: Direct access to eCourts India (ecourts.gov.in) for the 1969 case was not possible via web search; the case predates digitization. The investigation relied on reported case numbers and outcomes. The FIR copy released by K. Sudhakaran (2021) was not independently authenticated against police records.
- **Evidence standard applied**: The truth skill's evidence hierarchy was strictly applied. Court judgments (Tier 1) and election affidavits (Tier 1) were given precedence over political statements (Tier 7) and partisan media (Tier 7-8) in all conflict resolution.
- **Distinction between accusation and conviction**: Indian law presumes innocence until proven guilty. An FIR is an accusation. An acquittal is a judicial finding of insufficient evidence. Neither constitutes proof of guilt.
