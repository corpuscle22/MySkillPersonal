# Investigation: "Veena Vijayan Has Committed Financial Crimes"

**Date**: February 15, 2026
**Subject**: Whether Veena Vijayan (daughter of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan) has committed financial crimes
**Input**: Written claim — "Pinarayi Vijayan's daughter Veena Vijayan has committed financial crimes"
**Investigator**: Truth Skill — Evidence-Based Investigation

---

## Executive Summary

The claim that "Veena Vijayan has committed financial crimes" is **partially supported by ongoing institutional investigations but NOT yet adjudicated by any court**. The evidence picture is far more developed than a mere allegation — multiple independent investigative agencies have made formal findings of fraud — but no court has yet delivered a verdict.

Three separate government investigative bodies have independently concluded that Veena Vijayan's company, **Exalogic Solutions Pvt Ltd**, received payments from **Cochin Minerals and Rutile Limited (CMRL)** for services that were never rendered:

1. **Income Tax Interim Board for Settlement** (2019-2020): Found ₹1.72 crore paid to Exalogic by CMRL for non-existent IT services, noting payments were made "due to her relationship with a prominent person."
2. **Registrar of Companies (RoC), Bengaluru**: Preliminary investigation found **no documentation** to substantiate services Exalogic allegedly provided to CMRL; flagged potential violations under Sections 447 (fraud) and 448 (falsification of documents) of the Companies Act.
3. **Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO)**: Filed a formal **chargesheet/prosecution complaint** naming Veena Vijayan as the **11th accused** (among 27 total accused), alleging ₹2.73 crore in fraudulent payments under **Section 447 of the Companies Act** (corporate fraud). The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has **approved prosecution** (April 2025).

Additionally, the **Enforcement Directorate (ED)** has registered a money laundering case (ECIR) under the **Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)** against Veena Vijayan and Exalogic Solutions, based on the SFIO complaint.

The **Karnataka High Court** (February 2024) upheld the legality of the SFIO investigation, dismissing Exalogic's challenge. However, the **Kerala High Court** (April 2025) granted a temporary **status quo** in the SFIO case while reviewing CMRL's petition challenging the report's conclusions.

**Veena Vijayan denies all allegations**, stating in an affidavit that Exalogic is not a "benami" company, that transactions with CMRL were legitimate and backed by valid contracts, and that her father had no role in the company. CM Pinarayi Vijayan has publicly defended the deals as legal.

**Verdict**: The claim that financial crimes have been "committed" is **PREMATURE — the matter is under active prosecution, not yet adjudicated**. However, the underlying evidence is substantial: three independent investigating agencies have found no legitimate services were provided for the payments received, a formal chargesheet has been filed under fraud provisions, prosecution has been approved, and a money laundering case is active. This significantly exceeds a mere political allegation.

**Confidence**: **High** in the factual recitation of institutional findings; **Medium** on the ultimate guilt question (pending trial).

## Evidence Map

### Claim 2: Exalogic Received Payments for Services Not Rendered

**Verdict**: Confirmed by multiple independent agencies
**Confidence**: High

**Supporting Evidence (by tier)**:

#### Tier 1 — Primary Documents / Official Findings

- **Income Tax Interim Board for Settlement finding (2019-2020)**:
  Following IT Department searches at CMRL premises in 2019, the Board found that CMRL paid Exalogic Solutions ₹1.72 crore between 2017-2020 for IT services that were not provided. CMRL's own Managing Director, **S.N. Sasidharan Kartha**, reportedly informed the IT Department that despite payments being made per the contract, **no services were rendered**. The Board noted payments were made "due to her relationship with a prominent person."

- **Registrar of Companies (RoC) Bengaluru — Preliminary Report**:
  RoC investigation found **no documentation** to substantiate the services supposedly provided by Exalogic to CMRL. Recommended potential action under Sections 447 (fraud) and 448 (falsification of documents) of the Companies Act, 2013.
  - *Sources*: The Statesman, Janam TV, New Indian Express

- **SFIO Chargesheet / Prosecution Complaint**:
  Filed against 27 accused, naming Veena Vijayan as **11th accused** and Sasidharan Kartha as **1st accused**. Charges under **Section 447 of the Companies Act** (punishment for fraud). Alleges ₹2.73 crore received by Exalogic from CMRL without legitimate services. The SFIO's final complaint states payments were used to repay a ₹50 lakh private debt of Exalogic to EICIPL (Empower India Capital Investments Pvt Ltd, a firm owned by Sasidharan Kartha) — effectively shifting a private liability onto a public company. Email records reportedly focused on invoice generation and payment processing rather than actual work.

- **Ministry of Corporate Affairs — Prosecution Approval (April 2025)**:
  The Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs officially approved prosecution of Veena Vijayan based on the SFIO chargesheet.

- **Enforcement Directorate — ECIR Registration (March 2024)**:
  The ED registered a money laundering case under PMLA against Veena Vijayan and Exalogic, based on the SFIO complaint and IT Department findings. The ECIR notes CMRL inflated expenditures by booking bogus cash expenses used for illegal payments.
  - *Sources*: Hindustan Times, Economic Times, Tribune India, NDTV, Business Standard, The Week

- **Karnataka High Court Judgment (February 16, 2024)**:
  Dismissed Exalogic Solutions' writ petition challenging the SFIO investigation. The court upheld the government's authority to assign the SFIO investigation under Section 212 of the Companies Act. Emphasized the SFIO's multi-disciplinary expertise in uncovering complex corporate frauds. Found the investigation was justified given suspicions of serious wrongdoing including illegal payments and undisclosed related-party transactions.

#### Tier 1 — Corporate Registration Records

- **Ministry of Corporate Affairs / MCA Portal**:
  Exalogic Solutions (OPC) Pvt Ltd — CIN: **U72200KA2014OPC0766509**. Incorporated September 19, 2014 in Bangalore. Director: Veena Thaikkandiyil (Veena Vijayan). Authorized and paid-up capital: ₹1 lakh. Revenue FY 2021-22: ₹5.43 lakhs. Filed for **dormant status** in November 2022 — reportedly without disclosing ongoing proceedings, which is itself a potential Companies Act violation.

#### Tier 4 — Broader Financial Irregularities at CMRL

- The SFIO probe uncovered broader financial irregularities at CMRL totaling **₹182 crore**, including misreported expenses and fraudulent commissions. The Centre stated illegal payments were made to various political functionaries and entities.

### Claim: Veena Vijayan's Defense

**Evidence (by tier)**:

#### Tier 2 — Official Statements by the Accused

- **Veena Vijayan's Affidavit (Kerala High Court)**:
  - Exalogic is not a "benami" company; she founded it independently in 2014, two years before her father became CM (May 2016)
  - Her father had no role in the company's business, financial or otherwise
  - All transactions with CMRL were legitimate, transparent, conducted electronically, and backed by valid contractual agreements for IT services
  - Opposed calls for a CBI probe, arguing the SFIO investigation is sufficient
  - *Sources*: The Hindu, New Indian Express, The Statesman

- **CM Pinarayi Vijayan's public statements**:
  - Defended his daughter and her firm, asserting business deals were legal and all norms were followed
  - *Source*: Economic Times

- **CPI(M) Party Position**:
  - The investigations are politically motivated by the BJP-led Central government
  - *Sources*: Economic Times, Tribune India

**Analysis of Defense**: The defense rests on assertions of contract legitimacy. However, three independent investigating bodies — the IT Board (under the Union Finance Ministry), the RoC (under MCA), and the SFIO (under MCA) — have all independently concluded that no services were rendered. CMRL's own MD confirmed to the IT Department that services were not provided. The accused's assertion of legitimate contracts directly contradicts the factual findings of the investigating agencies. This conflict will ultimately be resolved at trial.

### Additional Allegation: UAE Bank Account & International Transactions

**Verdict**: Unverified — Single-source political allegation
**Confidence**: Low

- BJP leader Shaun George alleged that Exalogic maintained an account at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (UAE) and received payments from SNC Lavalin and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).
- A Dubai-based entity named **Exalogic Consulting** has publicly denied any ties to Veena Vijayan's Exalogic Solutions, stating her company does not operate in the UAE.
- This remains an unverified political allegation with no corroborating documentary evidence found.

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Were legitimate IT services actually rendered?** The investigating agencies say no. Veena Vijayan says yes. Email records reportedly show invoicing and payment activity rather than work product. The trial will need to examine contractual deliverables, if any exist.

2. **Why did CMRL's own MD (Sasidharan Kartha) confirm no services were provided?** This is significant because the statement came from the person who authorized the payments — it is essentially an admission by the payee's representative. His motivations and potential plea arrangements are unclear.

3. **What was the role of KSIDC (Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation)?** The SFIO investigation also covers KSIDC, which holds a stake in CMRL. Whether state government officials facilitated the alleged arrangement is part of the ongoing probe.

4. **₹182 crore in broader CMRL irregularities**: The SFIO uncovered financial irregularities far beyond the Exalogic payments. The full scope of these irregularities and who benefited has not been fully disclosed.

5. **UAE bank account allegation**: BJP's claim about an Exalogic account at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank receiving payments from SNC Lavalin and PwC remains unverified. A Dubai-based Exalogic Consulting denied any connection.

6. **Second SFIO prosecution complaint**: Reports indicate the SFIO is expected to file a second prosecution complaint against Veena Vijayan. The contents are not yet public.

7. **Trial timeline**: Given the Kerala HC's interim status quo order and ongoing appeals, the trial timeline is uncertain. The substantive trial has not begun.

## Methodology Notes

- **Databases searched**: MCA corporate registry (via Tracxn, Zaubacorp, ClearTax, IndiaFilings), Indian Kanoon (legal database), Karnataka HC and Kerala HC orders (via Verdictum, MetaLegal, LiveLaw, Bar and Bench), Income Tax Board records (via reporting), national news archives (The Hindu, Indian Express, NDTV, Hindustan Times, Economic Times, India Today, News Minute, Live Mint, Business Standard, Tribune India, The Week, Onmanorama, New Indian Express, The Statesman, Swarajya Magazine, OpIndia, Kerala Kaumudi, Janam TV).
- **Evidence strength assessment**: This case has **unusually strong pre-trial evidence** because three independent government agencies reached the same conclusion independently (IT Board, RoC, SFIO), a key participant (CMRL's MD) effectively confirmed the allegations to the IT Department, a High Court upheld the investigation's legality, and the MCA approved prosecution. However, **no court has adjudicated guilt**, and the accused maintains innocence. Indian law requires the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt at trial.
- **Political context**: The investigations are carried out by Central government agencies (under the BJP-led NDA government) against the daughter of the CPI(M) Chief Minister of Kerala. CPI(M) alleges political motivation. The courts have thus far upheld the legitimacy of the investigations. This context is noted for transparency but does not alter the evidence analysis.
- **Distinction between investigation findings and conviction**: Agency findings and chargesheets establish that a prima facie case exists — they do not constitute a conviction. The presumption of innocence applies until a court delivers judgment.
