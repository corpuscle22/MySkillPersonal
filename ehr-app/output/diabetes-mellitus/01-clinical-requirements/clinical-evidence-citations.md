## Clinical Practice Guidelines

### ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes 2026
- **Source**: American Diabetes Association
- **Year**: 2026
- **URL**: [https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/49/Supplement_1/S27/163926/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/49/Supplement_1/S27/163926/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes)
- **PMC**: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12690183/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12690183/)
- **Level of Evidence**: Grade A (well-designed clinical studies)
- **Key Recommendations**:
  - Diabetes diagnosed at HbA1c >= 6.5%, FPG >= 126 mg/dL, 2-hr OGTT >= 200 mg/dL, or random glucose >= 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms
  - Prediabetes defined as HbA1c 5.7-6.4%, FPG 100-125 mg/dL, or 2-hr OGTT 140-199 mg/dL
  - In asymptomatic individuals, diagnosis requires two abnormal test results from the same sample or two separate tests
  - Testing should begin at age 35 for all adults, earlier if risk factors present
- **Application**: Defines the diagnostic thresholds used in the clinical decision logic

### ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes 2025
- **Source**: American Diabetes Association
- **Year**: 2025
- **URL**: [https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S27/157566/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S27/157566/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes)
- **Level of Evidence**: Grade A
- **Key Recommendations**:
  - Reaffirms use of both HbA1c and plasma glucose-based tests as valid diagnostic tools
  - HbA1c offers long-term view, doesn't require fasting
  - FPG more effective for detecting early abnormalities in some populations
  - Using both tests together improves diagnostic accuracy when borderline
- **Application**: Supports multi-test confirmation pattern in clinical logic

### USPSTF Screening Recommendation 2021
- **Source**: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
- **Year**: 2021
- **URL**: [https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/screening-for-prediabetes-and-type-2-diabetes](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/screening-for-prediabetes-and-type-2-diabetes)
- **PubMed**: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34427594/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34427594/)
- **Grade**: B recommendation
- **Key Recommendations**:
  - Screen adults 35-70 years with overweight or obesity
  - Lowered starting age from 40 to 35 years
  - Screen every 3 years with normal results
  - Offer/refer patients with prediabetes to preventive interventions
- **Application**: Defines target population for screening; supports clinical utility of identifying prediabetes

- **Key Findings**:
  - HbA1c >= 6.5% recommended as diagnostic threshold
  - Threshold chosen based on inflection point for retinopathy risk
  - HbA1c advantages: no fasting required, less day-to-day variability
- **Application**: Establishes scientific basis for HbA1c 6.5% threshold

### DETECT-2 Study

- **Journal**: Diabetes Care
- **Year**: 2011
- **DOI**: 10.2337/dc10-1206
- **PubMed URL**: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270188/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270188/)
- **Level of Evidence**: Pooled cross-sectional analysis
- **Key Findings**:
  - Retinopathy prevalence increases sharply above FPG 126 mg/dL, 2-hr PG 200 mg/dL, and HbA1c 6.5%
  - Supports current diagnostic thresholds based on complication risk
- **Application**: Provides outcome-based validation for diagnostic thresholds

### Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Outcomes Study
- **Authors**: Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group
- **Title**: Long-term effects of lifestyle intervention or metformin on diabetes development and microvascular complications
- **Journal**: Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol
- **Year**: 2015
- **DOI**: 10.1016/S2213-8587(15)00291-0
- **PubMed URL**: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26377054/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26377054/)
- **Level of Evidence**: Randomized controlled trial (long-term follow-up)
- **Key Findings**:
  - Lifestyle intervention reduced diabetes incidence by 58% in prediabetes
  - Metformin reduced incidence by 31%
  - Benefits persisted over 15-year follow-up
- **Application**: Establishes clinical utility of identifying prediabetes for intervention

  - HbA1c unreliable in conditions affecting RBC lifespan
  - Anemia, transfusions, ESRD affect HbA1c accuracy
  - Alternative markers (fructosamine, glycated albumin) may be needed
- **Application**: Informs exclusion logic for ESRD/dialysis patients
