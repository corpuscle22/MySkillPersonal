# Clarification Patterns

Use these domain-specific question templates when the user's intent is ambiguous or when scope depends on clinical context. Ask at most 3 questions per round. Lead with the highest-impact question.

## Laboratory Result Groups

### Vitamin/Nutrient Groups
- "Should the group include only **direct measurements** of the vitamin, or also **functional biomarkers** (e.g., methylmalonic acid for B12, homocysteine for folate)?"
- "Should **metabolite** or **pathway-related enzyme** tests be included (e.g., DHFR activity for folate groups)?"
- "Is this for **screening** (fewer, high-yield tests) or **comprehensive diagnostic workup** (broader panel including confirmatory tests)?"

### Organ Function Groups (e.g., liver, kidney, thyroid)
- "Should this include only the **standard panel components** (e.g., hepatic function panel), or also **extended/specialty markers** (e.g., GGT, 5'-nucleotidase, ceruloplasmin for liver)?"
- "Should **autoimmune markers** relevant to the organ be included (e.g., anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin for thyroid)?"
- "Is the intent **screening**, **diagnostic**, or **monitoring** an established condition?"

### Infectious Disease Groups
- "Should the group include **serology** (antibodies), **molecular** (PCR/NAAT), **antigen** tests, or **all modalities**?"
- "Is this for **acute diagnosis**, **exposure screening**, or **immunity verification**?"
- "Should **culture-based** methods be included?"

### Autoimmune/Inflammatory Groups
- "Should this include only **disease-specific autoantibodies**, or also **general inflammatory markers** (ESR, CRP)?"
- "Is this for **initial diagnostic workup** or **monitoring disease activity**?"
- "Should **complement levels** and **immunoglobulin quantitation** be in scope?"

### Tumor Marker Groups
- "Should this include **screening markers**, **diagnostic/confirmatory markers**, or **monitoring markers** (or all)?"
- "Is the group for a **specific malignancy** or a **general cancer screening** panel?"
- "Should **genetic/molecular markers** (e.g., gene mutations, circulating tumor DNA) be in scope, or only **serum protein markers**?"

### Toxicology/Drug Monitoring Groups
- "Is this for **therapeutic drug monitoring** (quantitative levels), **drug screening** (qualitative detection), or **both**?"
- "Should the group include **metabolites** of the monitored drugs?"
- "Should **point-of-care** and **confirmatory (GC-MS/LC-MS)** methodologies both be included?"

### Specimen-Type Ambiguity
- "Should this group be limited to **serum/plasma** measurements, or should it include other specimen types (e.g., urine, CSF, whole blood, tissue)?"
- "Should **24-hour urine** and **random/spot urine** variants both be included?"

## Medication Groups

### Therapeutic Class Groups
- "Should this include only **FDA-approved agents** for the stated indication, or also agents commonly used **off-label**?"
- "Should **combination products** containing the target drug class be included (e.g., hydrocodone/acetaminophen for an opioid group)?"
- "Is this for **prescribing decisions**, **medication history review**, **exposure surveillance**, or **contraindication screening**?"

### Formulation Scope
- "Should the group include **all formulations** (oral, injectable, topical, ophthalmic, inhaled), or only a specific route?"
- "Should **OTC formulations** be included alongside prescription agents?"
- "Should **compounded preparations** be in scope?"

### Brand/Generic Scope
- "Should the group be mapped at the **ingredient level** (generic), or do you need **brand-specific** entries?"
- "Should **biosimilars** be included alongside reference biologics?"

### Lifecycle Scope
- "Should **discontinued or withdrawn** drugs be included (relevant for historical medication reconciliation)?"
- "Should **investigational/pipeline agents** be included?"

## General (Both Types)

### Population
- "Is this for a **general adult** population, or should it be tailored for **pediatric**, **neonatal**, **obstetric**, or **geriatric** use?"

### Setting
- "Is this intended for **inpatient**, **outpatient/ambulatory**, **emergency department**, or **all settings**?"

### Default Assumptions (state when not asking)
When skipping clarification, explicitly state the assumed defaults:
> "I'm assuming: general adult population, all standard care settings, screening-level scope. Let me know if you'd like to adjust."
