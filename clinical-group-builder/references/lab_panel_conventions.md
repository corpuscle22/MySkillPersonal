# Common US Lab Panel Conventions

Reference these panel compositions when assessing practical scope boundaries for laboratory result groups. These reflect real-world ordering conventions at major US reference laboratories.

**Purpose:** Inform inclusion/exclusion decisions. Do NOT use proprietary panel names as the group definition — use them as scope reference points.

## Standard Panels (Widely Standardized)

### Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)
Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, CO2 (Bicarbonate), Calcium

### Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
BMP components + Total Protein, Albumin, Bilirubin (Total), ALP, ALT, AST

### Complete Blood Count (CBC)
WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, Platelet Count
*With differential adds:* Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils (% and absolute)

### Lipid Panel
Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Cholesterol (calculated), VLDL (calculated in some labs)

### Hepatic Function Panel
Total Protein, Albumin, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, ALP, ALT, AST

### Thyroid Panel (Basic)
TSH, Free T4
*Extended:* + Free T3, Total T3, Total T4

### Coagulation Panel (Basic)
PT, INR, aPTT
*Extended:* + Fibrinogen, D-dimer, Thrombin Time

### Iron Studies
Serum Iron, TIBC, Transferrin Saturation, Ferritin

## Specialty Panels (Vary by Lab)

### Vitamin B Panel
- **Quest:** B1 (Thiamine), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin as NAD), B5 (Pantothenic acid), B6 (Pyridoxal phosphate), B7 (Biotin), B9 (Folate), B12 (Cobalamin)
- **LabCorp:** Typically individual orders; vitamin B12 and folate are most common
- **ARUP:** B1, B6, B12, Folate; also offers methylmalonic acid and homocysteine as functional markers
- **Mayo:** Offers B1, B6, B12, Folate; methylmalonic acid separate

### Anemia Panel / Workup
Varies widely. Commonly: CBC with diff, Reticulocyte count, Iron/TIBC/Ferritin, B12, Folate, Haptoglobin, LDH, Bilirubin (indirect), Peripheral smear

### Celiac Panel
tTG IgA, Total IgA, Deamidated Gliadin IgA, Deamidated Gliadin IgG, Endomysial Ab IgA

### Rheumatologic Panel
ANA, RF, Anti-CCP, ESR, CRP, Complement C3/C4, dsDNA Ab, Smith Ab, RNP Ab

### Hepatitis Panel (Acute)
HBsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HAV IgM, Anti-HCV

### Thyroid Autoimmune Panel
Anti-TPO, Anti-Thyroglobulin, TSI (Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin)

### Tumor Markers (Common)
PSA, AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 15-3/27.29, hCG, LDH

### Urine Drug Screen
- **Standard immunoassay (5-panel):** Amphetamines, Cannabinoids, Cocaine, Opiates, PCP
- **Extended (10-panel):** + Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Methadone, Methaqualone, Propoxyphene
- **Confirmatory:** GC-MS or LC-MS/MS for each positive screen

## Key Observations for Group Building

1. **Standard panels** (BMP, CMP, CBC, Lipid) are nationally standardized — safe to define uniform scope
2. **Specialty panels** vary significantly between labs — define the group by clinical intent, not by a single lab's panel composition
3. **Reflex testing** patterns differ by lab (e.g., some labs reflex to Free T3 when TSH is abnormal) — consider whether reflex tests should be in the group
4. **Methodology differences** (immunoassay vs. LC-MS/MS) can affect which LOINC codes apply — document whether the group is method-agnostic or method-specific
5. **Point-of-care (POC)** tests often have separate LOINC codes — decide whether POC variants are in scope
