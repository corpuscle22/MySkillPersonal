# Group Definition: Vitamin B Measurement and Related Tests Laboratory Result

**Generated:** 2026-02-19
**Group Type:** Laboratory Result
**Terminology Standard:** LOINC (Component Level)

---

## 1. Clinical Scope Statement

> **Clinical Scope Statement:** This group captures laboratory tests that directly measure the eight B-complex vitamins (B1/thiamine, B2/riboflavin, B3/niacin, B5/pantothenate, B6/pyridoxal phosphate, B7/biotin, B9/folate, B12/cobalamin) and the functionally related biomarkers used to confirm or differentiate B-vitamin deficiency states (methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, holotranscobalamin). It is used in the clinical evaluation of nutritional deficiency, malabsorption, megaloblastic anemia, neuropathy, and metabolic workup across primary care, hematology, neurology, gastroenterology, and obstetric settings. It includes direct measurements, active metabolite forms (thiamine pyrophosphate, pyridoxal phosphate), B12 transport proteins (holotranscobalamin II, unsaturated B12 binding capacity, transcobalamin II), and the key autoimmune marker intrinsic factor antibody used in pernicious anemia diagnosis. It excludes genetic testing (MTHFR, PANK2), IgE allergy antibody tests, dietary intake assessments, newborn screening interpretations, deprecated LOINC codes, drug-induced platelet antibody assays, and enzyme activity assays (biotinidase, erythrocyte transketolase). The group is method-agnostic, property-agnostic, and includes all clinically relevant specimen types (serum, plasma, whole blood, RBC, urine, CSF, DBS).

## 2. Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion Criteria

### Inclusion Criteria

| # | Criterion | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Direct measurement components for all 8 B vitamins** (B1–B12) | Core analytes that directly quantify the nutrient the group is intended to capture |
| 2 | **Active metabolite forms** (thiamine pyrophosphate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, nicotinamide, 4-pyridoxate) | Biologically active or catabolite forms measured by reference labs (e.g., ARUP measures B1 as TPP in whole blood; Mayo measures B6 as PLP) |
| 3 | **Functional biomarker: methylmalonic acid (MMA)** | Definitive confirmatory test for B12 deficiency — elevated MMA with normal homocysteine distinguishes B12 from folate deficiency ([Medscape](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204066-workup)) |
| 4 | **Functional biomarker: homocysteine** | Elevated in both B12 and folate deficiency; recommended ancillary test in equivocal cases ([ARUP Consult](https://arupconsult.com/content/vitamin-b12-deficiency)) |
| 5 | **Holotranscobalamin II (active B12)** | Metabolically available B12 fraction; early marker of B12 deficiency ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) |
| 6 | **Unsaturated B12 binding capacity** | Used in evaluation of B12 transport disorders and myeloproliferative conditions |
| 7 | **Transcobalamin II and Apo-transcobalamin II** | Biologically active B12 transport protein; directly related to B12 functional status |
| 8 | **RBC folate** | Reflects long-term tissue folate stores (~120 days); more reliable than serum folate for chronic deficiency ([Cleveland Clinic](https://clevelandclinic.org/)) |
| 9 | **Intrinsic factor antibody** (all variants: blocking, IgG, presence, quantitative) | Diagnostic marker for pernicious anemia — most common cause of B12 deficiency in developed countries ([Merck Manual](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/)) |
| 10 | **B6 vitamers pattern interpretation** (PLP + pyridoxal + pyridoxine composite) | Specialized interpretation for B6-dependent epilepsy and pyridoxine-dependent conditions |
| 11 | **Folate + Cyanocobalamin combined interpretation** | Composite interpretation code commonly reported when both tests are co-ordered |
| 12 | **5-Methyltetrahydrofolate/Folate ratio** | Active folate fraction used in specialized folate metabolism assessment |
| 13 | **MMA/Creatinine ratio in urine** | Creatinine-normalized urinary MMA for specimen concentration correction |
| 14 | **All clinically relevant specimen types**: serum, plasma, whole blood, RBC, urine, 24h urine, CSF, DBS | Group is not specimen-restricted; clinical relevance drives inclusion |
| 15 | **Property-agnostic**: mass concentration (MCnc), molar concentration (SCnc), combined (MSCnc), qualitative (PrThr), titer, rates | Ensures coverage across labs using different reporting units |
| 16 | **Method-agnostic**: immunoassay, LC-MS/MS, RIA, microbiologic assay, all other methods | Different methods yield different LOINC codes but measure the same analyte |

### Exclusion Criteria

| # | Criterion | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Genetic/molecular testing** (MTHFR genotyping, DHFR gene analysis, PANK2 gene mutation analysis) | Genetic tests, not measurement of B-vitamin levels or their functional biomarkers |
| 2 | **IgE allergy antibodies to B vitamins** (thiamine IgE Ab, cobalamin IgE Ab) | Allergy testing, not nutritional status assessment |
| 3 | **Dietary intake assessments** (Vitamin B2/B3/B5/B7 intake 24h estimated/measured) | Population-level nutrition survey instruments, not laboratory measurements |
| 4 | **Newborn screening interpretations** (biotinidase deficiency NBS interpretation) | Newborn screening is a distinct clinical domain with its own group definitions |
| 5 | **Deprecated/obsolete LOINC codes** | Deprecated codes should not be actively used for new result capture |
| 6 | **Drug-induced platelet antibody assays** (Niacin+Lovastatin induced platelet IgG/IgM Ab) | Drug hypersensitivity testing, not B-vitamin measurement |
| 7 | **Biotinidase enzyme activity/presence** | Enzyme activity assay for inborn error of metabolism screening — distinct from direct biotin level. *Exception:* include if explicitly requested for a biotinidase-deficiency–specific group |
| 8 | **Spermatid counts by streptavidin-biotin method** | Unrelated test that happens to use biotin as a reagent |
| 9 | **Parietal cell antibodies** | Non-specific autoimmune marker; belongs in autoimmune panel, not B-vitamin group |
| 10 | **Transcobalamin I, III, and combined I+III** | Storage/transport proteins not directly indicative of B12 functional status; primarily research interest. *Transcobalamin II IS included* |
| 11 | **MMA/Homocysteine ratio and MMA/Urea ratio** | Derived ratios with limited clinical standardization; individual analytes already included |
| 12 | **S-adenosylhomocysteine** | Intermediate methionine cycle metabolite; not part of standard B-vitamin deficiency workup |
| 13 | **Homocysteine cysteine disulfide** | Specialized metabolite fraction, not routinely ordered |
| 14 | **Cobalamin renal clearance** | Specialized renal physiology test |
| 15 | **Amniotic fluid methylmalonate** | Prenatal testing context outside typical B-vitamin group scope |
| 16 | **Erythrocyte transketolase activity** | Largely obsolete functional test replaced by direct thiamine/TPP measurement |
| 17 | **2-Pyridone/N'-methylnicotinamide ratio** | Research-level niacin metabolite ratio; not standard clinical assessment |
| 18 | **Homocystine** (oxidized dimer) — unless specifically requested | Distinct from homocysteine; associated with homocystinuria screening, a separate diagnostic domain |
