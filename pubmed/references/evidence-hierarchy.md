# Evidence Hierarchy in Medical Research

Quick reference for evaluating medical evidence quality.

## Levels of Evidence (Strongest to Weakest)

| Level | Study Type | Score | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 1a | Meta-analysis | 10 | Systematic review of multiple RCTs with statistical pooling |
| 1b | Systematic Review | 9 | Comprehensive review with defined methodology |
| 2a | RCT | 8 | Randomized controlled trial |
| 2b | Practice Guideline | 8 | Evidence-based clinical guidelines |
| 3 | Clinical Trial | 7 | Non-randomized clinical trial |
| 4 | Cohort Study | 6 | Prospective/longitudinal observational study |
| 5 | Case-Control | 5 | Retrospective comparison study |
| 6 | Narrative Review | 4 | Expert summary (non-systematic) |
| 7 | Case Report/Series | 3 | Individual patient descriptions |
| 8 | Expert Opinion | 2 | Based on clinical experience |

## When Synthesizing Results

1. **Prioritize high-quality evidence** (Scores 8-10) for main conclusions
2. **Use medium-quality evidence** (Scores 5-7) for supporting details
3. **Mention lower-quality evidence** (Scores 1-4) only when higher evidence is lacking
4. **Note conflicts**: When high-quality studies disagree, explicitly state the controversy
5. **Recency matters**: More recent high-quality studies generally supersede older ones

## Red Flags in Medical Literature

- Small sample sizes (n < 30 for clinical outcomes)
- Single-center studies for rare findings
- Industry-funded studies without independent replication
- Narrative reviews presented as systematic reviews
- Studies with high risk of bias (no blinding, high dropout)

## Citation Best Practices

When citing, include:
- First author + year
- Study type (e.g., "meta-analysis", "RCT")
- Sample size when notable
- PMID hyperlink for verification
