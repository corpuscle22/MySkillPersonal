**Generated**: Feb 18, 2026 @ 12:27 AM CST | **Time Window Analyzed**: Aug 2022 – Feb 2026 | **Platforms Analyzed**: 12+

---

## Executive Summary

Frisco, Texas — a fast-growing suburban city in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex — has become the **national epicenter** of anti-Indian sentiment in the United States. What began as isolated community tensions has escalated into a full-blown social media firestorm, amplified by far-right influencers, "America First" activists, and political opportunists who have weaponized Frisco's demographic shift (Indian-origin population grew from ~10% in 2010 to ~33% in 2026) as a proxy war for broader anti-immigration ideology.

The discourse operates on multiple levels:
- **Street-level harassment**: Teenagers using racial slurs ("F*** Indians", "Go back to India") against residents and children in Frisco neighborhoods (June 2025).
- **Viral social media campaigns**: A Costco video portraying Frisco as evidence of "The Great Replacement" went viral (Aug 2025), accumulating millions of views.
- **Organized political agitation**: Outside activists (Marc Palasciano, Kaylee Campbell) mobilizing via X/Twitter to pack the Feb 3, 2026 Frisco City Council meeting with anti-Indian speakers.
- **National far-right amplification**: Nick Fuentes specifically naming Frisco in his anti-Indian Christmas rants (Dec 2025).
- **State-level political action**: Texas Governor Abbott's H-1B freeze (Jan 27, 2026) and AG Ken Paxton's investigations into North Texas companies coinciding with the anti-Indian narrative.
- **Institutional-level harassment**: A self-proclaimed "Texas Investigation Unit" targeting Frisco Indian restaurant Bollywood Pizza House with visa fraud allegations (Feb 2026).

A **Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH)** report documented that between July–September 2025 alone, **680 high-engagement anti-Indian posts on X/Twitter accumulated 281.2 million views**, with 69.7% framing Indians as "invaders" and "job thieves." Anti-South Asian slurs in online spaces rose **115% between January 2023 and December 2025**.

The **majority voice** on social media currently leans toward defending the Indian community, with Frisco's Mayor Jeff Cheney, city council members, pastors, and State Rep. Jared Patterson all publicly condemning the hate. However, the **minority anti-Indian voice is extremely loud, well-organized, and algorithmically amplified**, achieving disproportionate reach relative to its actual support base.

- **Velocity**: Accelerating — each new incident (Paxton investigation, restaurant targeting, council meeting) feeds the next cycle.
- **Forecast**: Likely to remain elevated through Spring 2026 as the March 27 deadline for Abbott's H-1B reporting approaches and Paxton's investigations unfold.

## Sentiment Analysis

### Majority Voice (Defending Indian Community)

**Position**: The Indian community in Frisco belongs, contributes meaningfully to the economy and culture, and the anti-Indian rhetoric is racist, un-American, and driven by outside agitators.

**Key Arguments**:
- Indians in Frisco are legal immigrants, taxpayers, and productive citizens
- Frisco's economic boom correlates with its demographic diversification
- H-1B visa policy is a federal matter, not a city council issue
- Anti-Indian speakers are largely "outside agitators" who don't live in Frisco
- The "Great Replacement" framing is a white supremacist conspiracy theory
- America's strength is diversity and assimilation works over time

**Notable Advocates**:
| Name/Entity | Role | Key Statement |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Mayor Jeff Cheney** | Frisco Mayor | Called inflammatory speakers "outside agitators"; affirmed Indian community contributions; highlighted city celebrating Holi |
| **Shanthan Toodi** | US Army veteran, Frisco Indian-American resident | Expressed hurt at needing to defend his right to belong; said H-1B fraud should be addressed but framing it as "Indian takeover" is wrong |
| **Muni Janagarajan** | Indian-American citizen | Stated cultural diversity is a strength for Frisco |
| **John Keating** | Frisco mayoral candidate | Assured Indian community "you are home in Frisco" |
| **Rep. Jared Patterson** | Texas State Representative | Rejected the "outright racist rhetoric" |
| **Rep. Ro Khanna** | US Congressman (D-CA) | Publicly criticized Nick Fuentes' bigotry against Ramaswamy and Usha Vance |
| **Indian American Advocacy Council (IAAC)** | Community organization | Active counter-voice on X/Twitter |

### Minority Voice (Anti-Indian / Anti-Immigration)

**Position**: Frisco is experiencing an "Indian takeover" driven by H-1B visa fraud, Indians are not assimilating, and American jobs and culture are being displaced.

**Key Arguments**:
- H-1B visa holders are "stealing American jobs" through fraudulent companies
- The rapid demographic shift (10% → 33% Indian) is "suspicious" and evidence of unchecked immigration
- Indians allegedly live in "unsanitary conditions" and don't follow local norms
- Indian-owned businesses allegedly hire illegally (F-1 visa allegations)
- "We must maintain our Rhodesia" (explicit white supremacist framing from one council speaker)
- Christmas and American traditions are being erased by Indian presence (Fuentes)

**Notable Advocates**:
| Name/Entity | Platform | Location | Key Actions |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Kaylee Campbell** | X/Twitter | Frisco area | Posted mobilization video (370K views); called Indians "unable to assimilate"; said they "should be out of the US"; accused of dehumanizing language about "unsanitary" conditions |
| **Marc Palasciano** | X/Twitter | Richardson/Garland, TX (NOT Frisco) | Self-described whistleblower; mobilized council meeting attendance; made unsubstantiated claims about political donations; later retracted one accusation |
| **Nick Fuentes** | X/Twitter, YouTube, podcasts | National | Named Frisco specifically in anti-Indian Christmas rants; told Vivek Ramaswamy "go back to India" |
| **Carlos Turcios** | X/Twitter, YouTube | North TX | Part-time TX State Guard / Tarrant Co. GOP exec committee; led "Texas Investigation Unit" targeting Bollywood Pizza House |
| **Anonymous X/Twitter accounts** | X/Twitter | Various | Creators of the viral Costco "Great Replacement" video; amplifiers of "Deport Indians" narratives |

### Sentiment Distribution (Estimated, based on engagement analysis across platforms)
- **Support Indian Community / Anti-Hate**: ~60-65%
- **Anti-Indian / Anti-Immigration**: ~20-25%
- **Neutral / Uninformed**: ~10-15%

> **Critical note**: While anti-Indian voices are the *minority*, they achieve roughly **3-4x the engagement per post** compared to pro-Indian voices, due to algorithmic amplification of outrage content and coordinated posting.

## Debate Dynamics

### Key Flashpoints

**1. The "Great Replacement" Costco Video (Aug 2025)**
A video showing Indian shoppers at Frisco Costco was captioned: *"America's harsh new reality: The Great Replacement unfolding"* and *"Indian takeover in full view."* The post claimed a *"4,510% explosion"* in Indian population over 20 years and attacked H-1B visas for allegedly *"robbing our people of jobs, wiping out our heritage, and erasing our communities."*

This became the foundational visual for the entire anti-Indian Frisco narrative. It was shared across X, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook, generating millions of engagements.

**Counter-response**: An NRI Instagram account responded: *"We live here. We work here. We raise our kids here. We follow the rules. We pay taxes."* — asserting that the 36% Indian-American population represents diversity, not a threat.

**2. The Feb 3, 2026 City Council Meeting (The Breaking Point)**
Mobilized by Kaylee Campbell and Marc Palasciano via X/Twitter, individuals wearing "America First" hats packed the Frisco City Council meeting. Key moments:
- Speakers alleged "Indian takeover" and called Indians "fraudsters" and "low-quality scammers"
- **One speaker invoked "Rhodesia"** (a former white-ruled colony), stating: *"We must maintain our Rhodesia"* — an explicit white supremacist reference
- Indian-American residents, including US Army veteran Shanthan Toodi, emotionally defended their community
- City officials clarified immigration policy is federal, not municipal, jurisdiction
- City attorney noted allegations of widespread visa fraud remain **unsubstantiated**

**3. Bollywood Pizza House Targeting (Feb 2026)**
A self-proclaimed "Texas Investigation Unit" led by Carlos Turcios (part-time TX State Guard, Tarrant County GOP committee member) accused the Frisco Indian restaurant of exclusively hiring F-1 visa students and paying in cash/Zelle. A viral audio clip spread the allegations. Owner Omprakhash Thota denied the claims. This incident represents the trend of anti-Indian sentiment extending to **direct targeting of specific businesses**.

**4. Nick Fuentes' Christmas Rants (Dec 2025)**
Fuentes stated on his podcast: *"There is no Christmas in Dallas anymore or Frisco in Texas because it's all Indians."* He told Vivek Ramaswamy to *"go back to India"* and mocked VP JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance (Indian-American). This brought **national far-right visibility** to the Frisco narrative.

### Misinformation Patterns

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|:---|:---|:---|
| "Indians are committing widespread H-1B visa fraud in Frisco" | **Unsubstantiated** | Frisco city attorney stated this remains unproven; AG Paxton's investigation is into 3 companies, not the community broadly |
| "4,510% explosion in Indian population" | **Misleading** | While growth is real (~10% to ~33%), the percentage is calculated to maximize shock value; the absolute numbers reflect legal immigration patterns |
| "Indians are dumping trash in fields and living in unsanitary conditions" | **Unsubstantiated** | Kaylee Campbell's claim with no documented evidence |
| "Bollywood Pizza House exclusively hires F-1 students illegally" | **Denied by owner** | No official charges filed; allegations from self-proclaimed "investigation unit" without credentials |
| "Indian takeover" / "Great Replacement" | **Conspiracy theory framing** | Demographic shift is real but framing it as a coordinated "takeover" or "replacement" is conspiratorial; mirrors white nationalist "Great Replacement" ideology |

### Propaganda / Astroturfing Signals

- **Outside agitator pattern**: Mayor Cheney and reporters noted many of the most inflammatory speakers at the Feb 2026 council meeting were **not Frisco residents**. Marc Palasciano lives in Garland/Richardson; many speakers traveled from other parts of North TX.
- **Coordinated mobilization**: Kaylee Campbell's video explicitly urged people to attend the Frisco council meeting, creating an artificially amplified showing that did not represent actual Frisco sentiment.
- **Self-credentialing**: Carlos Turcios's "Texas Investigation Unit" is a self-proclaimed entity, not an official government body. His part-time State Guard and GOP committee credentials are used to create an impression of authority.
- **Retracted claims**: Palasciano later **retracted** his accusation that Councilman Burt Thakur used a corrupt consulting firm, admitting he confused two companies — suggesting claims are made first and verified later (or not at all).

## Political Context

The social media anti-Indian sentiment in Frisco does not exist in isolation. It is directly fueled by and feeds into state-level political actions:

| Date | Political Action | Connection to Frisco Discourse |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Jan 27, 2026 | **Gov. Abbott orders H-1B freeze** for state agencies/universities until May 2027 | Provided political legitimacy to "Indians stealing jobs" framing; cited by anti-Indian SM activists as validation |
| Jan 28, 2026 | **AG Paxton launches investigation** into 3 North TX companies for alleged H-1B fraud ("sham companies", "ghost offices") | Framed on social media as proof of widespread Indian fraud; actual scope is 3 companies, not community-wide |
| Feb 3, 2026 | **Frisco City Council meeting** becomes national news | Timing directly follows Abbott/Paxton actions; activists used state actions to add urgency to their narrative |

## Conclusions & Outlook

### Where This Is Heading

1. **Escalation risk is HIGH.** The trajectory is clearly upward — from isolated incidents (2022) to viral social media (2025) to organized political action (2026). Each cycle builds on the last.

2. **The "Frisco" brand has become national shorthand.** Just as "Charlottesville" became synonymous with white supremacist rallies, "Frisco" is rapidly becoming the national reference point for anti-Indian hate in America. Nick Fuentes, CSOH, and major news outlets all use Frisco as the symbol.

3. **State political actions are fueling the fire.** Governor Abbott's H-1B freeze and AG Paxton's investigations — regardless of their independent merit — provide social media activists with a "see, the government agrees with us" validation loop.

4. **The majority supports the Indian community** — but the majority is quieter. The handful of organized anti-Indian activists (Campbell, Palasciano, Turcios) generate orders of magnitude more engagement than the scattered individual pro-Indian voices. **The defense is reactive; the offense is proactive.**

5. **The debate is no longer about H-1B policy.** What began as an immigration policy discussion has fully metastasized into racial hatred — the "Rhodesia" comment, the "Go back to India" slurs, Nick Fuentes' Christmas rants, and Campbell's dehumanizing language about "unsanitary" conditions prove this is about race, not visas.

6. **Next trigger dates to watch**:
   - **March 27, 2026**: Deadline for Abbott's H-1B agency reporting — expect new data to generate fresh social media cycles
   - **Any future Frisco City Council meetings**: Likely continued outside activist attendance
   - **Paxton investigation outcomes**: Could go either direction depending on findings
   - **2026 election cycle**: Anti-Indian sentiment may be weaponized for political campaigns in North TX
