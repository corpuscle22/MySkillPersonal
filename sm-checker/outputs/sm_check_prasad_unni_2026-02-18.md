## Search Methodology

### Platforms Searched (21+)
X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, Substack, Medium, Quora, Telegram, Discord, Rumble, Gab, Gettr, Truth Social, Pinterest, Snapchat, SocialBlade, SocialSearcher, Web Archive

### Search Strategies Used
- Site-specific operators (e.g., `site:x.com "Prasad Unni"`)
- Username pivot searches (`prasadunni`, `prasad_unni`, `prasad.unni`, `punni`)
- Boolean combinations (name + controversy, name + political terms, name + bias terms)
- Archived/cached content searches
- Professional network cross-referencing (IMO Health → LinkedIn → ResearchGate → Google Scholar → PubMed)
- Identity disambiguation against other "Prasad Unni" individuals

### Tools Used
- `search_web` — Cross-platform discovery (50+ queries executed)
- `read_url_content` — Direct page content extraction (IMO Health, PubMed)
- `browser_subagent` — Attempted (unavailable due to environment issue; compensated with additional web searches)

### Limitations
1. **Browser subagent unavailable**: Due to a Playwright environment configuration issue, direct browser navigation was not possible during this investigation. Additional `search_web` and `read_url_content` calls were used to compensate.
2. **LinkedIn content**: LinkedIn blocks direct content scraping (HTTP 999). Profile existence and URL were confirmed via IMO Health bio page, but profile content (posts, articles, connections, activity) could not be directly reviewed.
3. **Private accounts**: Any private or locked social media accounts would not be discoverable through public search methods.
4. **Name commonality**: "Prasad Unni" is shared by multiple individuals (endocrinologist in Bangalore, urologist in Kerala, marketing professor in Tennessee), requiring careful identity disambiguation throughout the investigation.
