### Assessment/Plan Formatting
Common formats for A&P section:
1. **Numbered problem list**: Each problem numbered with plan underneath
2. **Systems-based**: Organized by organ system
3. **Paragraph format**: Narrative summary
4. **SOAP format**: Integrated with HPI and exam findings

Look for diagnoses in the Assessment section or problem list portion of the note.
