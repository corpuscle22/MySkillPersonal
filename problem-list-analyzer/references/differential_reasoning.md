## Evidence Hierarchy

When inferring diagnoses, prioritize evidence sources in this order:

1. **Objective findings** - Lab values, imaging, physical exam findings
2. **Symptom patterns** - Classic presentations of known diseases
3. **Risk factor profiles** - Pre-existing conditions + demographics
4. **Epidemiological likelihood** - Disease prevalence in population

## Demographic-Based Reasoning

### Age-Specific Considerations

| Age Group | Key Differential Considerations |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Neonate (0-28 days) | Congenital anomalies, sepsis, metabolic disorders, birth trauma |
| Infant (1-12 months) | RSV, rotavirus, intussusception, SIDS risk factors, developmental delays |
| Toddler (1-3 years) | Foreign body ingestion/aspiration, otitis media, croup, febrile seizures |
| Child (4-12 years) | Strep pharyngitis, asthma, appendicitis, growing pains vs pathology |
| Adolescent (13-18 years) | Sports injuries, mental health, substance use, pregnancy considerations |
| Young Adult (19-40 years) | Anxiety/depression, STIs, autoimmune onset, trauma |
| Middle Age (41-64 years) | Cardiovascular risk, diabetes onset, cancer screening age, menopause |
| Elderly (65+ years) | Polypharmacy effects, atypical presentations, falls, cognitive decline |

### Sex-Specific Considerations

**Female patients - Consider:**
- Pregnancy in reproductive age (always rule out)
- Ectopic pregnancy with abdominal pain
- Ovarian pathology (torsion, cysts, malignancy)
- Breast pathology
- Osteoporosis (postmenopausal)
- Autoimmune conditions (higher prevalence)
- UTI (higher prevalence)
- Thyroid disorders (higher prevalence)

**Male patients - Consider:**
- Prostate pathology (age > 50)
- Testicular pathology
- Cardiovascular disease (earlier onset than females)
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (age > 65, smoking history)
- Gout (higher prevalence)

## Symptom Pattern Recognition

### Chest Pain Differentials

| Pattern | Top Differentials | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Substernal, crushing, radiating to arm/jaw | ACS, stable angina | Risk factors, troponin, ECG changes |
| Pleuritic (sharp, worsens with breathing) | PE, pericarditis, pleuritis, pneumonia | D-dimer, CXR, friction rub |
| Positional (worse lying down) | Pericarditis, GERD | Relieved sitting forward (pericarditis) |
| Reproducible with palpation | Costochondritis, MSK | Tenderness on exam |
| Burning, epigastric | GERD, PUD, gastritis | Meal association, relief with antacids |

### Abdominal Pain Differentials

| Location | Top Differentials | Key Features |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| RUQ | Cholecystitis, hepatitis, biliary colic | Murphy's sign, LFTs, RUQ US |
| LUQ | Splenic pathology, pancreatitis, gastritis | Lipase, LUQ tenderness |
| RLQ | Appendicitis, ovarian (female), ectopic | McBurney's, psoas sign, beta-hCG |
| LLQ | Diverticulitis, ovarian (female), ectopic | CT findings, fever |
| Epigastric | PUD, pancreatitis, GERD, MI | Lipase, troponin, meal association |
| Periumbilical | Early appendicitis, SBO, gastroenteritis | Migration pattern, obstruction signs |
| Suprapubic | UTI, bladder pathology, gynecologic | UA, pelvic exam |
| Diffuse | SBO, peritonitis, mesenteric ischemia | Distension, guarding, lactate |

### Dyspnea Differentials

| Onset | Top Differentials | Key Features |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Acute (minutes) | PE, pneumothorax, anaphylaxis, MI | D-dimer, CXR, troponin |
| Subacute (hours-days) | Pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, CHF exacerbation | CXR, BNP, sputum |
| Chronic (weeks-months) | COPD, CHF, ILD, anemia | PFTs, echo, CBC |

### Headache Differentials

| Pattern | Top Differentials | Red Flags |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Sudden, severe ("thunderclap") | SAH, ICH, CVA | CT head, LP if CT negative |
| With fever/stiff neck | Meningitis, encephalitis | LP, empiric antibiotics |
| With visual changes | Temporal arteritis (age > 50), migraine with aura, IIH | ESR/CRP, ophthalmology |
| Postural (worse standing) | CSF leak, post-LP | History of procedure |
| Morning, with nausea | Increased ICP, brain tumor | Imaging |
| Unilateral, throbbing | Migraine, cluster | Aura, lacrimation, duration |
| Band-like, bilateral | Tension-type | Stress association |

## Risk Factor Integration

### Cardiovascular Risk Factors

When present, increase suspicion for:
- **Coronary artery disease**: Chest pain, dyspnea
- **Stroke/TIA**: Neurologic symptoms
- **Peripheral arterial disease**: Claudication, non-healing wounds
- **Aortic pathology**: Abdominal/back pain

Risk factors:
- Hypertension
- Diabetes mellitus
- Hyperlipidemia
- Smoking
- Family history of premature CAD
- Obesity
- Prior CVD events

### Thromboembolic Risk Factors

Increase suspicion for DVT/PE when present:
- Recent surgery/immobilization
- Active malignancy
- Prior VTE
- Pregnancy/postpartum
- Oral contraceptive/HRT use
- Obesity
- Long-distance travel
- Inherited thrombophilia

### Malignancy Risk Factors

Consider occult malignancy workup with:
- Unexplained weight loss (> 5% in 6 months)
- New anemia without obvious cause
- Unexplained fatigue
- Night sweats
- Age-appropriate cancer screening overdue
- Family history of hereditary cancer syndromes
- Tobacco/alcohol use

## Laboratory/Imaging Interpretation

### Common Lab Abnormalities and Inferred Conditions

| Finding | Consider | Additional Workup |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Elevated WBC | Infection, inflammation, leukemia, stress | Differential, cultures |
| Low hemoglobin | Anemia - determine type (MCV) | Iron studies, B12, folate, retic count |
| Elevated creatinine | AKI or CKD - compare to baseline | UA, renal US, prior values |
| Elevated troponin | ACS, PE, myocarditis, demand ischemia | ECG, serial troponins, clinical context |
| Elevated BNP | Heart failure, cor pulmonale | Echo, clinical assessment |
| Elevated D-dimer | PE/DVT (if pretest probability warrants) | CT-PA, lower extremity US |
| Elevated lipase | Pancreatitis | CT abdomen, etiology workup |
| Elevated LFTs | Hepatic pathology - pattern matters | Hepatitis panel, RUQ US, medication review |
| Elevated TSH | Hypothyroidism | Free T4, symptoms correlation |
| Low TSH | Hyperthyroidism | Free T4, Free T3 |
| Elevated glucose | Diabetes, stress hyperglycemia | HbA1c, fasting glucose |
| Hyponatremia | SIADH, CHF, cirrhosis, volume depletion | Volume status, urine studies |
| Hyperkalemia | Renal failure, medication effect, hemolysis | ECG, repeat level, renal function |

## Clinical Decision Rules

Apply validated clinical decision rules where applicable:

### PE Probability (Wells Criteria)
- Clinical signs/symptoms of DVT: +3
- PE is #1 diagnosis or equally likely: +3
- Heart rate > 100: +1.5
- Immobilization/surgery in past 4 weeks: +1.5
- Previous PE/DVT: +1.5
- Hemoptysis: +1
- Malignancy: +1

### Ottawa Ankle Rules
For ankle injury - X-ray if:
- Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of lateral malleolus
- Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of medial malleolus
- Inability to bear weight immediately and in ED

### PERC Rule (PE Rule-Out)
If ALL negative, PE can be excluded clinically:
- Age < 50
- HR < 100
- SpO2 > 94%
- No prior DVT/PE
- No recent surgery/trauma
- No hemoptysis
- No exogenous estrogen
- No unilateral leg swelling
