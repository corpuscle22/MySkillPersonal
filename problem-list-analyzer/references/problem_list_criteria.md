## Core Principles

### What is a Problem List?

A problem list is a comprehensive, curated list of a patient's health issues that:
- Informs clinical decision-making
- Communicates important health information across care settings
- Persists across encounters
- Requires ongoing attention or consideration

### Guiding Questions

Ask these questions for each potential problem:

1. **Persistence**: Will this problem be relevant beyond this encounter?
2. **Management**: Does this require ongoing monitoring, treatment, or consideration?
3. **Safety**: Would future providers need to know this for safe care?
4. **Clinical impact**: Does this affect other conditions or treatment decisions?

If YES to any question, the problem likely belongs on the list.

### Category 2: Significant Acute/Resolved Conditions

**Include** acute conditions with lasting implications:

- History of myocardial infarction
- History of stroke/TIA
- History of pulmonary embolism
- History of deep vein thrombosis
- History of cardiac arrest

**Major infections:**
- History of sepsis
- History of infective endocarditis
- History of meningitis
- History of osteomyelitis

**Malignancy:**
- Any cancer diagnosis (active or history)
- Precancerous conditions (Barrett's, colon polyps, MGUS)

### Category 3: Surgical History (Clinically Relevant)

**Include** surgeries affecting future care:

- Cardiac surgery (CABG, valve repair/replacement)
- Organ transplant

## Exclusion Criteria

### Minor Acute Illnesses

**Exclude** self-limited conditions without long-term implications:

| Condition | Exclude UNLESS |
|-----------|----------------|
| Common cold/URI | Recurrent (> 6/year) suggesting immunodeficiency |
| Acute pharyngitis | Documented as strep with rheumatic fever history |
| Simple headache | Documented as chronic migraine |
| Minor laceration | Complicated by infection or significant scarring |
| Insect bite | Significant allergic reaction requiring documentation |
| Muscle strain | Chronic or related to underlying condition |
| Acute gastroenteritis | Chronic, recurrent, or with complications |
| Seasonal allergies | Documented as chronic allergic rhinitis |
| Acute bronchitis | Recurrent or in COPD patient |
| Conjunctivitis | Chronic or related to autoimmune condition |
| Athlete's foot | Chronic or immunocompromised patient |
| Mild rash | Chronic dermatologic condition |

### Symptoms Without Diagnosis

**Exclude** isolated symptoms unless:
- They represent an ongoing concern requiring monitoring
- They have been evaluated and found significant
- They are part of a symptom complex suggesting specific disease

Examples:
- Single episode of chest pain, evaluated and cleared - exclude
- Chronic fatigue requiring ongoing evaluation - include
- Transient dizziness, resolved - exclude
- Recurrent syncope under investigation - include

## Edge Cases

### Resolved Conditions

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Cancer in remission | INCLUDE - affects screening, monitoring |
| Resolved PE/DVT | INCLUDE - affects anticoagulation decisions |
| Resolved AKI | INCLUDE if recurrent or CKD risk |
| Treated infection | EXCLUDE unless complications |
| Past pregnancy | EXCLUDE unless complications documented |
| Childhood asthma, none as adult | INCLUDE if clinically relevant history |

### Preventive/Risk States

| Obesity | INCLUDE - affects multiple conditions |
| Family history of disease | INCLUDE only hereditary syndromes |
| Tobacco use | INCLUDE as "tobacco use disorder" |
| Alcohol use disorder | INCLUDE |
