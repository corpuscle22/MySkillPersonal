## Style Guidelines

### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Academic/Journal | Scholarly, measured | "The evidence suggests that..." |
| Magazine Feature | Narrative, engaging | "Walk through any village in Tamil Nadu and you'll see..." |
| Op-Ed | Assertive, urgent | "It is time India woke up to..." |
| Blog | Conversational, passionate | "Here's what they won't tell you..." |

### Voice Principles

**DO:**
- Write with confidence and authority
- Use active voice
- Be specific with facts and dates
- Quote primary sources when possible
- Acknowledge complexity while maintaining clarity
- Use rhetorical questions effectively
- Build cumulative arguments

**DON'T:**
- Sound defensive or victimized
- Use excessive exclamation marks
- Rely on ad hominem attacks
- Make claims without evidence
- Use internet slang or casual abbreviations
- Sound preachy or moralistic without substance

### Sentence Variety

Mix sentence lengths for rhythm:
- Short declarative statements for impact
- Medium sentences for explanation
- Longer sentences for complex analysis (but avoid run-ons)

**Example:**
> The temple stood for eight hundred years. It witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, the prayers of countless devotees, the passage of seasons and centuries. Then, in 1669, it was demolished on Aurangzeb's orders. What rose in its place was not merely a mosque—it was a statement of civilizational conquest.

## Opening Hook Examples

### The Provocative Statistic
> "In the 500 years of Islamic rule in India, an estimated 60,000 Hindu temples were destroyed. Yet in modern secular India, discussing this history is considered 'communal.' The question is not why Hindus wish to reclaim their sacred sites—it's why they were expected to forget."

### The Personal/Narrative
> "My grandmother never crossed the threshold of our ancestral temple in Pakistan. When she fled during Partition at age twelve, she carried nothing but a small idol of Lord Krishna wrapped in her dupatta. That temple still stands in what is now Lahore—converted, like her homeland, into something unrecognizable. This is not ancient history. This is living memory."

### The Paradox
> "India is perhaps the only major democracy where the majority community is in perpetual need of defending itself against charges of majoritarianism—while actual minority appeasement is codified into law. This curious inversion of victimhood and privilege deserves examination."

### The Historical Parallel
> "In 1193, the library of Nalanda burned for three months. It was said that the smoke could be seen from miles away. Today, a different kind of destruction is underway—not of manuscripts, but of memory itself. The systematic erasure of India's Hindu past from its educational curriculum represents a continuation of that civilizational vandalism."

### The Current Event Hook
> "The images from [current event] have sparked outrage across social media. But to understand what is happening, one must look beyond yesterday's headlines—back through centuries of a conflict that India refuses to honestly confront."

## Quote Bank

### Swami Vivekananda
> "Each nation, like each individual, has one theme in this life, which is its centre, the principal note round which every other note comes to form the harmony. If any nation attempts to throw off its national vitality, the direction which has become its own through the transmission of centuries, that nation dies."

> "The Hindu refuses to call you a sinner. The Hindu says you are God and will prove it."

> "Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached."

### Sri Aurobindo
> "India is not a piece of earth; she is a power, a godhead, for all nations are godheads. India is the Bharati."

> "Nationalism is simply the passionate aspiration for the realisation of the Divine Unity in the nation, a living unity in which all the constituent individuals are bound together by the sense of a single and overmastering idea."

### Sardar Patel
> "Every Indian should now forget that he is a Rajput, a Sikh or a Jat. He must remember that he is an Indian."

> "Manpower without unity is not a strength unless it is harmonized and united properly, then it becomes a spiritual power."

### Deendayal Upadhyaya
> "The basic cause of the problems facing Bharat is the neglect of its national identity."

### Rajiv Malhotra
> "The West has digested yoga, exported it back, and sold it to Indians minus its spiritual core."

> "Breaking India forces seek to weaken the Indian nation by creating internal divisions."

### Koenraad Elst

## Argumentative Patterns

### Pattern 1: Historical Correction
```
CLAIM: The mainstream narrative says X
EVIDENCE: But historical sources reveal Y
IMPLICATION: Therefore, we must correct our understanding to Z
```

**Example:**
> "We are taught that Mughal rule was a period of syncretic harmony. Yet the primary sources—Mughal court chronicles themselves—record systematic temple destruction as pious acts. The Baburnama, the Ma'asir-i-'Alamgiri, and countless farmans document demolitions. This is not Hindu revisionism. This is what the Mughals themselves wrote with pride."

### Pattern 2: Internal Contradiction
```
CLAIM: Proponents of X claim to value Y
EVIDENCE: But their actions/positions reveal they don't actually value Y
CONCLUSION: Therefore, X is intellectually dishonest
```

**Example:**
> "Those who invoke 'secularism' to oppose temple reclamation claim to value religious equality. Yet they are silent when Hindu temples remain under government control while mosques and churches enjoy autonomy. They invoke 'hurt sentiments' to ban Hindu religious practices but dismiss Hindu sentiments about destroyed sacred sites as 'communalism.' This is not secularism—it is selective application of principles to disadvantage one community."

### Pattern 3: Comparative Analysis
```
CLAIM: Indic approach to X produces better results than alternative approaches
EVIDENCE: [Historical/empirical comparison]
CONCLUSION: The Indic way offers wisdom for contemporary problems
```

**Example:**
> "The Western conception of rights is fundamentally adversarial—my rights against yours, individual against state. The Dharmic conception is relational—duties we owe each other, the cosmic order that binds creation. One produces litigation and polarisation. The other produces harmony and responsibility. As Western societies fracture, India's Dharmic wisdom becomes ever more relevant."

### Pattern 4: Reframing
```
MAINSTREAM FRAME: This issue is about X
INDIC REFRAME: Actually, it's about Y
EVIDENCE: [Support for the new frame]
```

**Example:**
> "The Ram Janmabhoomi movement is framed by opponents as 'Hindu nationalism.' This misses the point entirely. It is about civilizational memory—the right of a people to their sacred geography, violated by conquest, now being peacefully reclaimed through constitutional means. No other colonised people are asked to accept the symbols of their subjugation as permanent fixtures."

## Common Topics and Angles

### Temple Reclamation
- **Angle**: Historical justice, not communalism
- **Key points**: Archaeological evidence, constitutional arguments, peaceful legal process

### Secularism Critique
- **Angle**: Pseudo-secularism vs genuine secularism
- **Key points**: Asymmetric application, temple control, minority appeasement
- **Counter-argument**: "BJP/RSS wants Hindu Rashtra theocracy"
- **Rebuttal**: Hindu Rashtra is civilizational identity, not theocracy; Hinduism has no concept of theocratic rule

### Historical Revisionism
- **Angle**: Decolonising history, not falsifying it
- **Key points**: Colonial/Marxist distortions, primary source evidence
- **Counter-argument**: "This is saffronisation"
- **Rebuttal**: Correcting established distortions with evidence is scholarship, not ideology

### Hinduphobia in Media/Academia
- **Angle**: Double standards in coverage and scholarship
- **Key points**: Comparative analysis of coverage, pattern documentation
