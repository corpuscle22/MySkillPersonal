# Bangladesh's T20 World Cup Boycott: When Cricket Became a Shield for Civilisational Cowardice

*The ICC's principled stand exposes the moral bankruptcy of a regime that persecutes Hindus while crying victim*

---

In a fitting act of self-inflicted justice, Bangladesh has withdrawn from the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup. Their excuse? "Security concerns" about playing in India. The reality? A desperate attempt to escape accountability for the systematic persecution of Hindus that has turned their nation into a graveyard of temples and a hunting ground for minorities.

The facts are damning and undeniable. Since the student-led uprising ousted Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, Bangladesh has witnessed over 2,200 documented attacks on Hindu minorities. More than 80 Hindus killed. Over 60 temples desecrated. ISKCON centres torched. Monks arrested on fabricated charges. Hindu families locked inside their homes before those homes are set ablaze. This is not political violence—this is civilisational extermination.

And yet, when the BCCI rightfully directed Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladeshi pacer Mustafizur Rahman from his IPL contract—a proportionate response to a nation that has allowed open season on Indian civilisational brethren—Bangladesh's interim government cried foul. The regime that cannot protect Hindu temples from mobs suddenly found its voice to complain about a cricket contract.

## The "Security" Charade

The ICC conducted independent security assessments and found "no credible or verifiable security threat" to Bangladeshi players in India. The ICC Board voted 14-2 against Bangladesh's demand to move their matches to Sri Lanka. Only Pakistan—ever eager to weaponise any opportunity against India—supported the boycott. Even nations with no stakes in the India-Bangladesh dynamic refused to indulge this theatre.

But let us engage with the "security" argument on its own terms. If Bangladeshi cricketers cannot safely play in Kolkata and Mumbai—cities with millions of Muslim residents, iconic mosques, and a long history of Hindu-Muslim coexistence—then what does that say about Bangladesh's perception of India? And if such perception is genuinely held, what does it say about the climate Bangladesh has itself created through its dehumanisation of Hindus?

The truth is simpler: the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government knows that every Bangladeshi cricketer walking onto an Indian ground would be a reminder of the atrocities happening back home. The global spotlight of a World Cup match would inevitably illuminate the uncomfortable questions Dhaka wishes to avoid. It is not Indian fans that Bangladesh fears—it is Indian cameras.

## The Double Standards Mythology

Pakistan's cricket board, in a display of predictable solidarity, accused the ICC of "double standards"—pointing to India's refusal to play in Pakistan during the 2025 Champions Trophy. The comparison is intellectually fraudulent.

India's security concerns about Pakistan stem from decades of state-sponsored terrorism, cross-border infiltration, and attacks on Indian soil planned and executed from Pakistani territory. This is documented, acknowledged, and adjudicated by international bodies. India's concerns are about a hostile state apparatus.

Bangladesh's complaint, by contrast, is that India might be "hostile" because Indians are upset about the ethnic cleansing of their civilisational kin. One nation has legitimate security concerns arising from terrorism; the other is manufacturing victimhood to escape scrutiny for its own persecution of minorities. The two are not comparable.

## Consequences, Not Coercion

Critics—particularly the usual chorus in the Western media and India's own pseudo-secular intelligentsia—will frame the BCCI's actions as "using cricket for politics." This framing deserves to be rejected outright.

When Bangladesh banned the broadcast of the IPL in retaliation for Mustafizur's release, was that not politics? When the BCB demanded venue changes to avoid playing in India, was that not politics? When Bangladesh's government accused India of "exaggerating" reports of Hindu persecution even as temples burned, was that not politics?

The difference is that India's actions have consequences for those who persecute Hindus. Bangladesh's actions enable that persecution to continue without accountability. The BCCI did not "politicise" cricket—it refused to pretend that the savaging of Hindu minorities is irrelevant to cricketing relations.

This is as it should be. For too long, India conducted its foreign policy as if the treatment of Hindu minorities in the subcontinent was someone else's problem—a matter of "internal affairs" for nations built on the religious cleansing of Hindus at Partition. The Nehruvian consensus treated civilisational ties as embarrassments to be hidden rather than bonds to be honoured.

That consensus is dying. And Bangladesh is among the first to feel the change.

## The Civilisational Dimension

The persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh is not an isolated chapter of "political violence" as the Yunus government claims. It is the continuation of a 500-year assault on Dharmic civilisation in the subcontinent—from the destruction of Nalanda to the desecration of Somnath, from the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits to the present-day burning of ISKCON temples in Dhaka.

The Hindu population of Bangladesh has collapsed from approximately 30% at Partition to under 8% today. This demographic annihilation did not happen by accident. It happened through riots, forced conversions, land grabs, abductions, and periodic pogroms—each one explained away as an "isolated incident" or "criminal act" unconnected to the broader pattern.

India, as the civilisational homeland of Hindus, has a moral duty to ensure that those who participate in this erasure—or those who enable it through silence and complicity—face consequences. The T20 World Cup offered a rare moment of leverage. The BCCI used it. The ICC, to its credit, upheld the principle that manufactured grievances cannot override tournament logistics and host nation prerogatives.

## The Road Ahead

Bangladesh's boycott is a gift to Scotland, which now takes their place in Group C. It is also a gift to India's diplomatic positioning: the world has witnessed a nation boycott an international tournament rather than face questions about the persecution its government has enabled.

The Yunus government hoped that by framing the issue as one of "Indian aggression," it could rally international sympathy. Instead, the ICC's 14-2 vote demonstrated the bankruptcy of that narrative. Only Pakistan stood with Bangladesh—an alliance of convenience between two nations whose treatment of Hindus and other minorities speaks for itself.

For Bharat, this episode must not end with the World Cup. The denial of media accreditation to Bangladeshi journalists—another ICC decision that has drawn criticism from Dhaka—suggests that the cricketing body is unwilling to be bullied. This resolve must be matched by sustained diplomatic and economic pressure until Bangladesh demonstrates genuine protection for its Hindu citizens.

Cricket, for all its beauty, is ultimately a game. The lives of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh are not. If the former can create accountability for the latter, then the T20 World Cup 2026 will have accomplished something far more significant than crowning a champion.

Let Bangladesh sit out, nursing its invented grievances. The tournament—and civilisation—will proceed without them.
