# The Civilisation That Built Your World Now Faces Your Rage

## Anti-Indian Hatred in America Has Moved From Whisper to War Cry — And the Numbers Are Staggering

---

On a September evening in 2025, Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah — a fifty-year-old father, an Indian-origin motel owner in Dallas, Texas — was beaten to death at the place he had spent years building into a livelihood. Weeks later, in California, a twenty-six-year-old Indian man named Kapil was shot dead after he asked a stranger to stop urinating in public. In Virginia, a father and daughter from Gujarat — people who had crossed oceans to serve customers behind the counter of their small store — were gunned down by a man demanding alcohol.

These are not abstractions. These are names. These are skulls cracked, lives ended, families annihilated — not in a warzone, but in the United States of America, a nation whose technology sector, medical infrastructure, and corporate leadership have been substantially built by the very people now being hunted.

Something has shifted in America. The hatred against Indians — people of Indian origin, Hindu Americans, South Asian professionals — has crossed the threshold from online bile into body counts. And the trajectory, measured by every credible dataset available, is not flattening. It is accelerating.

## The Data: A 91% Surge in Hate, and Bodies to Show For It

The numbers are no longer ambiguous. Between October 2024 and October 2025, online trolling targeting Indian-origin individuals in the United States surged by **91 percent**, reaching 88,000 documented cases, with recorded threats nearly doubling in the same period. On X (formerly Twitter), anti-Indian racist posts peaked in August 2025, with 381 posts amassing nearly **190 million views** — a scale of hatred that makes the content functionally indistinguishable from a coordinated campaign.

These are findings from the **Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH)**, which documented an explosion of anti-Indian and anti-Hindu narratives across social platforms in 2025, warning that "such online rhetoric often precedes offline behavior." That warning was prophetic. The offline behaviour arrived — in the form of murders, shootings, and physical assaults across Virginia, Texas, California, and Pennsylvania.

The **FBI's 2024 Hate Crime Statistics**, released in August 2025, recorded 11,679 hate crime incidents and 14,243 victims for the calendar year 2024 — the second-largest total since the Bureau began collecting this data. Anti-Asian hate incidents — the nearest official category encompassing Indians — remained "alarmingly high," at nearly three times pre-pandemic averages. The **Stop AAPI Hate** organisation reported that **43 percent of South Asian adults experienced an act of hate in 2023**, while anti-South Asian online slurs doubled between January 2023 and August 2024.

And these are the numbers that *are* reported. The FBI's own methodology relies on voluntary law enforcement reporting, with 81 percent of participating agencies reporting zero hate crimes — a statistical impossibility that betrays the depth of undercounting. The Hindu American Foundation has repeatedly noted that anti-Hindu hate incidents are significantly underreported due to fear and cultural reluctance within the community.

Anti-Hindu hate crimes tracked by the FBI more than doubled from 2021 to 2022 and continued rising by 24 percent into 2023, reaching 31 nationally. In California alone — home to one of America's largest Hindu populations — anti-Hindu bias incidents rose for the fourth consecutive year.

## Temples Under Siege: When Hatred Becomes Desecration

The hatred has not spared sacred spaces. In January 2024, Vijay's Sherawali Temple in Hayward, California was defaced with pro-Khalistan graffiti — "Khalistan Zindabad" and slurs against Prime Minister Modi. Weeks later, the Swaminarayan temple in Newark, California was vandalised with slogans eulogising Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the architect of Sikh separatist violence that once tore through Punjab.

In September 2024, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Sacramento was vandalised with the message **"Hindus Go Back"** — a slogan that should give pause to anyone who believes America's hatred problem is limited to stray incivility. By March 2025, the BAPS Mandir in Chino Hills, Southern California — a breathtaking marble structure built by thousands of volunteer hours — was sprayed with "F— Modi and Hindustan" and **"Hindustan Murdabad"**: Death to Hindustan. Death to Hindus.

These temples are not merely places of worship. They are civilisational outposts — expressions of a 5,000-year-old tradition of sacred architecture, community service, and spiritual practice that has enriched every society it has touched. To vandalise them is not petty crime. It is cultural assault, directed at the most visible symbols of Hindu presence in America.

That many of these attacks have been linked to pro-Khalistan extremism — a separatist movement with documented roots in foreign intelligence operations and diaspora radicalisation — makes the American law enforcement response even more inadequate. These are investigated as "possible hate crimes," a phrase that reveals institutional reluctance to name what is plainly visible: a sustained, ideologically motivated campaign to intimidate the Hindu community on American soil.

## The Grotesque Irony: Hating the Hands That Built the House

Here is the fact that should render every anti-Indian bigot mute with shame:

Indian Americans constitute approximately **1.5 percent** of the US population. They pay an estimated **5 to 6 percent of all income taxes** — between $250 billion and $300 billion annually. Their businesses indirectly create **11 to 12 million American jobs**.

A 2025 study by the **Manhattan Institute** — not an Indian lobby group, but a rigorous, centre-right American think tank — found that Indian immigrants are the **single most economically beneficial immigrant group** in the United States. Each Indian immigrant and their descendants save the US federal government an average of **$1.6 to $1.7 million over 30 years**, reducing national debt and boosting GDP more than any other demographic group. H-1B visa holders, over 70 percent of whom are Indian, are projected to increase US GDP by nearly **$500,000 per person** and reduce federal debt by **$2.3 million each** over three decades.

Indian-origin CEOs head **16 Fortune 500 companies** — including Alphabet (Sundar Pichai), Microsoft (Satya Nadella), Adobe (Shantanu Narayen), and IBM (Arvind Krishna) — collectively employing **2.7 million Americans** and generating nearly **one trillion dollars** in annual revenue. Indian Americans have founded or co-founded **72 out of 358 unicorn startups** since 2018, valued at $195 billion. One-third of Silicon Valley's tech workforce is of Indian origin.

The median household income of Indian Americans is **$151,200** — almost twice the national average. Seventy-seven percent hold a bachelor's degree or higher. Only six percent live in poverty, lower than any other ethnic group in America.

These are not immigrants gaming a system. These are the architects of the system — the doctors who staff American hospitals, the engineers who build American infrastructure, the entrepreneurs who create American wealth, and the taxpayers who subsidise American governance. To hate them is not merely unjust. It is, by any rational measure, an act of economic and civilisational self-harm.

## The Three Engines of Hatred

The rising hostility operates through three distinct but interconnected vectors.

**First, the H-1B backlash and economic nativism.** The Trump administration's September 2025 revision of H-1B visa rules — hiking application fees to $100,000 and shifting to a wage-based selection model — was accompanied by an explosion of nativist rhetoric portraying Indians as "job stealers" and "visa scammers." Stop AAPI Hate and Moonshot documented a **69 percent surge in anti-South Asian online slurs** and a **12 percent rise in threats of violence** by November 2025. This is not organic resentment. It is manufactured outrage, amplified by political opportunism and algorithmic rage engines, and it has real consequences: a 2025 survey found that **49 percent of Indian Americans experienced bias**, with US-born Indian Americans — people who know no other home — reporting rates of **64 percent**. Eighty-one percent expressed concern about rising white nationalist threats.

**Second, Hinduphobia as an institutional project.** The targeted vandalism of Hindu temples, the academic delegitimisation of Hindu traditions in American universities, and the selective application of "human rights" rhetoric against India — while ignoring far greater atrocities elsewhere — constitute a pattern that is too consistent to be coincidental. Organisations like the **Indian American Muslim Council** and **Hindus for Human Rights** operate within American institutional frameworks to portray Hinduism as inherently oppressive, Hindu nationalism as fascism, and India as a threat to minorities — narratives that are dutifully amplified by outlets like *The Guardian* and various American university departments. This institutional Hinduphobia provides intellectual cover for street-level violence: when a civilisation is rhetorically dehumanised, its members become easier targets.

**Third, the geopolitical dimension.** The US-India tariff war of 2025 produced a spike in anti-Indian sentiment that the CSOH documented as a direct cause of the August 2025 X platform hate spike. When bilateral relations deteriorate, diasporic communities become proxy targets. Meanwhile, Khalistan separatist activism — which has Canadian governmental support through vote-bank politics and documented links to Pakistani intelligence — has found American soil an increasingly permissive space for anti-Hindu intimidation.

## A Dharmic Response: Neither Victimhood Nor Passivity

The Indic tradition does not counsel retreat in the face of adharma. It counsels *clarity*.

The Bhagavad Gita's injunction is not to avoid conflict; it is to engage it from a place of dharmic clarity: *"Karmany evadhikaras te ma phaleshu kadachana"* — your right is to the action, not to the fruit. The action required now is multi-dimensional.

**To the Indian-American community**: Organised political engagement is no longer optional. The Indian-American community must move beyond professional achievement and into institutional power — school boards, district attorneys' offices, congressional representation, media ownership. Achievement without institutional power is wealth without walls. The Hindu American Foundation, the Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA), and newer organisations must be supported not as cultural clubs but as civilisational defence mechanisms.

**To India**: The Ministry of External Affairs must treat attacks on the Indian diaspora with the same urgency it brings to territorial disputes. Every murdered Indian professional in America, every vandalised temple, every "Hindus Go Back" scrawled on sacred marble should trigger formal diplomatic communications. The soft-power leverage that India possesses — its technology workforce, its consumer market of 1.4 billion, its strategic location — must be deployed not merely for trade advantages but for civilisational protection.

**To America**: Consider what you are doing. You are directing hatred at the community that builds your hospitals, codes your software, leads your corporations, and subsidises your federal budget. You are vandalising the temples of a people whose philosophical traditions — yoga, meditation, non-violence, pluralism — you have adopted as wellness industries worth billions. You are shooting the fathers and daughters who sell you groceries at 2 AM because no one else will.

The Indic civilisation has survived invasions, colonialism, and partition. It will survive American bigotry. The question is whether America will survive the loss of the very people who make it work.

## The Numbers America Should Remember

Before the next viral video of an Indian being told to "go back," before the next temple is spray-painted, before the next motel owner is beaten to death — consider this accounting:

| What Indian Americans Contribute | The Scale |
|---|---|
| Share of US income taxes paid | 5-6% (from 1.5% of population) |
| Federal debt reduction per immigrant | $1.6-1.7 million over 30 years |
| Fortune 500 companies led | 16 |
| Americans employed by Indian-led Fortune 500 firms | 2.7 million |
| Revenue from Indian-led Fortune 500 firms | ~$1 trillion |
| Unicorn startups founded since 2018 | 72 (valued at $195 billion) |
| American jobs created indirectly | 11-12 million |
| Median household income | $151,200 (nearly 2x national average) |
| Share holding bachelor's degree or higher | 77% |

Every act of anti-Indian hatred is an act against the people who build America's wealth, heal America's sick, and code America's future. The bigots are welcome to their rage. The civilisation that gave the world zero, yoga, surgery, and the very concept of pluralism will endure, as it always has — not despite the darkness, but because it has always known how to find light within it.

*Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam* — the world is one family. But a family that brutalises its most productive members does not deserve that name.
